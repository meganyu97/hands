i'm looking for a pair of hands 
to pick me up from this brick labyrinth i've surrounded myself with
to show me how the misguided foes in life influenced my naïveté
built walls in my maze all leading to dead-ends
but the walls are all made of clay

i'm looking for a pair of hands
callused to the frigid air 
familiar with the bruises I hide
that people mistaken for soft spots

i'm looking for a pair of hands 
to hold and be held in 
strong enough to handle the broken shards
gentle enough to mold me back together when the rain 
washes my progress away

looking down, i unclench these fists
i run them under water 
watch the red stains unblanket my white knuckles
i salute the flag
and honorably discharge from the trench warfare 
bid the bodies of comrades who fought fearlessly through the battles farewell

the abandoned house on the hill
enter the room on the left
open the curtains drawn to shield
from the systematic violence of my memories
allow the light to reveal the girl sitting in the corner
and look down at these hands.
